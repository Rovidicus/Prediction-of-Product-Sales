## Sales prediction model for food items sold at various stores
1. Using a histogram, I got a bird's eye view of product weights as well as how many weights remain unaccounted for with the bar left of 0.

2. Another histogram displays the maximum retail price of items

3. This group boxplot gives an idea of sales figures by store size. It may be curious why medium sized stores outperform the other stores, but some data is still missing.

4. Here is a violin plot of item store sales by store type. The type 3 supermarket well outperforms its siblings with grocery stores only yeilding a fraction of sales.

5. I made a countplot of item types sorted by fat content. Only in meat and breakfast did "Regular" display more than "Low Fat".
